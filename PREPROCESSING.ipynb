The fireworks set to music were also well worth the wait ... with Disney cartoons projected onto the Castle.  Burger, chips & coke at the Royal Banquet Hall was good.  Meeting the Disney characters in the Fantasy Gardens was fun and queues were only about 15 mins at 6pm.  Lots of opportunities with professional photographers around the park.  Get a Disney Photopass from them and view photos later... but you do have to view before midnight if you want to buy any or they are wiped from website.

Water HK$25 a bottle, but you can refill at water fountains at every toilet block.  All rides great fun, some a little twee.  Recommend Grizzly Gulch Mountain Runaway train ride, Space Mountain, Toy Story car RC Racer, Its A Small World (well, you have to do it at each Disney!), Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Festival of the Lion King Show (why don't they let you wait in the air-conditioned theatre, instead of outside??) and the Disney Parade.  The fireworks set to music were also well worth the wait ... with Disney cartoons projected onto the Castle.  Burger, chips & coke at the Royal Banquet Hall was good.  Meeting the Disney characters in the Fantasy Gardens was fun and queues were only about 15 mins at 6pm.  Lots of opportunities with professional photographers around the park.  Get a Disney Photopass from them and view photos later... but you do have to view before midnight if you want to buy any or they are wiped from website.  Pick up a park guide plus a Times Guide for all the show times.  We didn't bother with a Fastpass either. I wouldn't go again, but it is definitely worth doing once for the experience!\",\n",

American relatives visiting so we just had to celebrate USA Independence Day at Disney... in an ex-British Colony ... with Chinese fireworks!  Entrance HK$450 per adult.

Water HK$25 a bottle, but you can refill at water fountains at every toilet block.  All rides great fun, some a little twee.  Recommend Grizzly Gulch Mountain Runaway train ride, Space Mountain, Toy Story car RC Racer, Its A Small World (well, you have to do it at each Disney!), Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Festival of the Lion King Show (why don\\'t they let you wait in the air-conditioned theatre, instead of outside??) and the Disney Parade.

Meeting the Disney characters in the Fantasy Gardens was fun and queues were only about 15 mins at 6pm.  Lots of opportunities with professional photographers around the park.

Safer to consume fruits and water.<br />Lot more to say but maybe you need to experience it. The weather is nice and they have halal restaurant too. The ride was fun and have a lot activities over there. Halal food was expensive but not very nice ,the Malaysian halal food place was closed so there was no choice.<br /><br />Over all is nice with kids Now on the foods, out of 2 halal restaurants, only 1 open, Explorer\\'s Club restaurant open from 12 pm-7 pm. So you have to plan your mealtime carefully to cover the parade/shows etc if you only there for 1 day. Price range from HKD99 for kids meals combo and HKD139-HKD159 for normal meals combo. Tastewise, quite average, the best bet here is to take Butter Chicken combo from Indian Spices, if you\\'re not big eater, you can share the combo actually as the portions quite big.   Hongkong Disneyland Park serve Halal Food in Explorer Club and Prayer Room (highly appreciate). Various souvenirs available in this Disneyland. Pleasure to be back.  Love that the staff had stickers (free! If you asked for them) and the best part was they offered halal certified eateries! ( well done Disney ! ) snacks and even a prayer room ( quiet room) with ablution facilities which was very important as we would want to spend the whole day in Disneyland and won’t want to compromise our prayer times :)  For Muslim visitors can now enjoy in-park meals at 2 Halal-certified restaurants, Tahitian Terrace in Adventureland & Explorer\\'s Club Restaurant in Mystic Point. The food was delicious!  There are alot of foods in disneyland hongkong. For muslim like us, no worries, as there is a halal food inside disneyland itself..  There are also halal food that definitely cater to my needs.

For muslim traveler, you shouldn’t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan’s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120-150 HKD if i’m not mistaken. Fun and enjoyable theme park for the family!  Muslim friendly as they have more halal food options! New rides and amazing shows and parade!  If you are looking for halal food the place is at adventure land. They serve asian food and quite resonable price.  they do have halal food and provide prayer room for muslim There is 2 halal-certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer\\'s Club for muslim travellers There are halal eateries available on the premise The place is clean, and for Muslim tourists, you dont have to worry about getting Halal food and Musollah, they provide and cater for you.  For Moslem travellers, there are halal restaurant and praying room near the restaurant.  As for us Muslims, we had options of Halal Food at The Explorers’ Cafe and also a little prayer room located next to the cafe  To my muslim friends.... there is a halal foodcourt in the theme park Our 1st ever experience at a disney land resort. It was lovely. Like the rest of Hong Kong You Gotta Be Prepated To Walk Walk Walk. Extremely unusual rides. Fun Characters. Dont let the rain put you off.<br />The toy shops are wow <br />Even adults were buying stuff lol.<br />Only downside is no muslim prayer room but there is 1 stand near the entrance selling halaal food.<br />Try the caramel popcorn. Too tasty and the smell is divine.  There is no masjid (mosque) so little bit difficult for moslem to pray. Every area have greatest show. We only get micky mouse show and very very great. We are very excited and so professional. Foodcourt have halal food A lot of food option and yes there is a HALAL option to.  For Disneyland, there are halal stores for muslim. <br /><br />I bought advance meal coupon from klook. This help me save a lot. Just remember to show it to them upon entering. You have to redeem it before entering Disneyland The best reason to visit HKDL :  there is halal food and a prayer room available. The variety of food has increased and now the Main Street Marketplace (the little snack shack in between the Main Street Bakery and the Chow Tai Fook jewelery store) is also certified halal and sells (wait for it) HALAL TURKEY DRUMSTICKS. Food is quite expensive over there, but..I guess it\\'s \"normal\" for such attractions. There are vegetarian and halal options too. It is small compared to other Disneyland. However, one of the best part of this Disneyland is that it served Halal foods. For Muslim travellers, I recommend you eat at this halal restaurant near Mystic Manor ride. The food is nice especially the Hainanese Chicken rice, though the price is slightly expensive. The park is clean by Hongkong standard and the cafetaria serve non halal food  There are halal options for Muslim guests who should note that the turkey/hot dog stand next to the bakery near the entrance is the only such stand in the park that has halal meat. Some restaurants are also halal certified only manage to walk around and enjoy the deco and halal food was good. Costly as usual.<br /> There is a halal food option in park and a lot of options for the sweet tooth. Overall a enjoyable family experience.  there is halal food at food stall and restaurant. For Muslims, they cater with Halal places at 2 locations:<br />1) Tahitian Terrace (Adventureland)<br />2) Explorer\\'s Club Restaurant (Mystic Point)  You will be surprised to know that Hong Kong Disneyland actually have two halal outlets namely The Explorer Club and the other The Tahiti Terrace.  There are two restaurants serving halal food for Muslim visitors as well as places for praying.   halal food is easy to get,   There’s a halal food too here, and also a prayer room (musholla) at Explorer Restaurant (Mystic Zone). Muslim-friendly too - with 1) restaurants serving halal food, 2) large & comfortable prayer hall & ablution rooms.  If you are looking for a halal food, there\\'s an indicator in the flyer for the halal restaurants and kiosk There is restaurant halal  There is halal option which is gd, the portions really makes us full. Halal food is a real change.. there is one halal restaurent but was closed on the day I visited..  I would suggest to the park management to consider having more halal food items (even though it exists; more variety would be better)  They have halal meal and praying room.  important thing for Moslems, there are 2 restaurants inside the Disneyland that provides halal food!!  The food selection is great, halal food available, there is also prayer room for moslem.  There\\'s only two halal eating places in Disneyland and one of them was closed when I visited Hong Kong Disneyland   There is also halal food stall available.  Halal restaurant available inside Disneyland which is a plus point.    The place is clean n child friendly only one minus point the food is very expensive as outside food are not allowed in but the good part we can get halal food so forget about the price although it may cost as much if not even more than the tickets you can get diffrent varites of food Including Halal Certified Food for anyone looking out for it.  The disneyland park did serve halal food so dining was pleasant experience.  Halal food available in the park. I highly recommend it. Besides, it is very difficult to find halal menus, so we didn\\'t eat anything.   They also provide new halal restaurant and a decent prayer room for moslem visitor. Great service overall.  For Muslim patrons there are two restaurants which are certified Halal  I really appreciated how Hong Kong Disneyland is the only Disneyland with a restaurant serving halal food. As a Muslim traveller, halal food can be hard to find at times. While the prices for the food are steep, I truly appreciated that they serve halal food at the Explorer\\'s Club. For a standard meal, it costs HK$139. Like others disneyland, this is a magical place of course, but my highlight would be their explorer club resto.. they provide halal food, and the manager are super friendly and helpful, i love her.  Had lunch at the halal restaurant- oversized  servings and for Malaysians with our currency, it was ridiculously expensive. The Explorer\\'s Club at Mystic Point also serves Halal food. We spent the whole day there and had no problem finding Halal food as there are few Halal restaurants within the Disneyland itself. Good food available and have halal option Roller coaster,  4D movie,  lionking story,  food , even for Muslim tourist halal restaurants was there. They have two certified Halal restaurants - The Explorers Club and Tahitian Terrace. The place is clean and if has Halal Food shops There are two restaurants which offer Halal cuisine in Hongkong Disneyland.   Highlight was that you can find many eating places, chinese, halal, malaysian, indian etc. Reasonably priced.  Halal foods are available  food/drinks carts are everywhere, halal restaurant is available so you can be there the whole day.  For muslims, there are two restaurants that serve halal food, but we went only to one, the Explorers Club at the Mystic Point. There were 2 restaurant serving halal food. We had our dinner at a restaurant serving international halal food.    As there are 13 of us which some were muslims, the only halal cafe will be the one at the Adventureland...& it was closed on that day. It wasnt stated on the Disneyland website or neither am I been notified or been highlighted that the cafe will be closed on that day (when i actually hv to specify the date i am going upon booking). We hv to search high & low for a halal cafe & was given ONLY 2 choices of meal which indeed was lousy taste. Some of the games were closed & the rest does not meet my expectations. So as the parade too...very boring.  the important thing is you could find halal restaurant within disneyland.  I\\'m not worry about the food because got 1 halal restaurant served halal meal (The Explores Club)  the halal food was so-so. Lots of good souvenir with reasonable price. They do sell Halal foods in Disneyland and the best way, is to purchase the voucher online as you will have discount! if you hungry they have restaurant around and if you moslem dont worry because they have halal restaurant too in Adventure land, named TAHITIAN RESTO.  Only 1 place serves Indian  Vegetarian food and Halal food which is bang opposite to Tarzan Tree house next to Porter Cabin.  I hope they will provide more muslim restaurants (halal food) inside the park in the future. Food is very expensive in the park. A simple combo meal cost about HK$190 but you can always buy the 3-in1 Supreme Meal Coupon for HK$278. The meal coupon includes lunch, dinner and a snack. If you visit during winter, be prepared for rainy days. For Muslim travellers, there are two Halal restaurants in the park. The best thing is they have 2 Halal restaurants, now thats a sure win!! One interesting about Disneyland HK, probably the only few theme park in the world, that offered a restaurant with halal certified. Muslims visitors could have a halal meal at 2 restaurant in the park - Tahitian Terrace in Adventureland (try rice noodle soup) and Explorer\\'s Club Restaurant in Mystic Point (delicious Nasi Goreng). However, as expected, the meal is quite costly. what can i say more about disneyland? its awesome!<br />very family friendly with baby room, many restaurants and halal one as well.   There is also alot of restaurants and halal restaurant is also available. So to those muslim travellers theres no worry about food but to take bote that the food is very expensive.  Happy Place. For Muslims, no problem, HALAL Food available within the park!  Halal food is available onsite as well. Weather is good and halal food is available - Tahitian Terrace & one in Mystic Point. We love this place. Available halal restaurant ( taste is so so) . Explorers come out with better menu option and taste better there\\'re 2 resto serving halal food. one is indian near the Lion King attraction, another one is Southeast asian food near the Mistery Manor attraction.<br />In the cowboy town also have fish and chips only shop.  There was a Halal restaurant and a place to pray for muslims which was very good The halal food @#24 quite delicious.   It has two Halal food restaurants located within Disneyland itself. My 5 yr old daughter loves it!<br /><br />2 halal food to eat You will find any kind tempting dishes from around the world including Halal food and vegetarian You cannot bring food from outside but Halal food is sold in the park. You should try the mickey waffle.  There is even a couple of halal restaurant so food is not a problem for muslims. For moslem, the only food there that halal certified is only at Tahitian Terrace, a couple minutes walk from the Main Street USA. And not to worry to muslim traveler as here is a halal food available in the them park. Foods are no problem. Most sections have one or two restaurants should you need to have a meal. They also serve Halal foods in two or three restaurants, which is nice to have if you are Muslim. I ate in one of the restaurants with East/South-East Asian cuisine.  there are halal restaurants  You can carry water but outside food is not allowed in here. Halal certified Muslim food and vegetarian food available and as expected expensive.  Met the culinary director Chef Muller, appreciate him and his team effort to come up with the 2 halal restaurants.  The most important is they sell halal food at one of the cafe. Very nice! Has halal food.<br />You can take your own food into the park.  Being Muslims, we were a little apprehensive about our dining options but we were pleasantly surprised to find \\'halal\\' meals sold at the \\'Adventureland\\' cafeteria and the restaurant right next to Mystic Manor they dont provide halal food options for tourists. A place to visit if you are in Hong Kong. If you\\'re muslims, there is halal food restaurant inside and you can still bring along your bottled of water or food as long as you dont picnic there. There is a restaurant in Disneyland that is halal certified! Its near the Haunted Manor, and for Muslims like us it was so great to be able to order proper nice meals without worrying it if it was halal or not (unlike Ocean Park which was very limited in food options for Muslims/kosher eaters) Still, it was quite a good thing for them to have halal food outlets here - with the number of visitors from the Middle East and Malaysia/Indonesia - they would have lost a good proportion of possible income otherwise. The food is ok, there is a halal food at Tahiti Restaurant  they even have halal food in the park for muslim tourists. you will get halal food at certain restaurants(one near tarzan\\'s tree house will serve halal food). But as a family man, I enjoyed it a lot. The entrance staffs even allowed us to bring some of our own foods and mineral water. Maybe because I\\'m with an infant. But I did try one of the two Halal restaurants. We bought the Briyani set and the Chicken Rice set. They were plentiful, tasty, and did not disappoint. Of course it was expensive - already expected that. what I don\\'t really like is the halal food court. It\\'s only in one location and it\\'s quite expensive. If I convert it to malaysian and indonesian currency.. it\\'s like one package of nasi lemak with chicken plus a cup of softdrink there is equal with a price of 2 times eating in pepper lunch ! or a set menu in Tony romas..huhuhuhu. Hong kong disney brings the fun side out of you, you can have your picture taken with disney characters and there are halal places to eat.  It also helps that the park serves Halal food. So all my muslim brothers/sister, rejoice!  there are a couple of restaurants that offer halal food.  Halal certified outlets no issue, 2 restaurants at Mystic pt (Explorers\\' Club & Tahitian Terrace).  Halal restaurants are available in the park. The Mickey waffle is definitely a must-try. I should say they taste just nice as a Parisian crepe. There\\'s 2 Halal joints inside Disneyland. One is at AdventureLand called Tahitian Terrace and one more at Mystic Point  called Explorer\\'s Club Restaurant. For halal food, head down to Tahitian Terrace, and don\\'t be fool by the name. It served Malaysian and Singaporean dishes. Am a Malaysian and I love it!<br />And don\\'t forget to try the Hong Kong style tea and coffee on Main Street.  For Muslims, there is one halal restaurant which I cant remember. Do check with the management for more details Halal food is available at one of the section, but doesn\\'t taste good. Food cost about S$20 per pax for a bowl of laksa + drink or a plate of chicken rice + drink. No take away service. We had Halal meals at Tahitian Terrace and for prayer, we went to the City Hall where we were given a nice room to pray there\\'s 2 restaurant that served halal food for muslim, 1 at mystic point and another one at adventure land.. me and my friends tried halal rstaurant at mystic point, the food portion quite big..the food was okay. Great atmosphere... A place for everyone in the family... <br /><br />I am a Moslem.... There 2 halal restaurants... No worries....  Even for Muslim travellers, there are 2 foodcourts serving good halal food ie Tahitian Terrace at Adventureland and another at Mystic Point. We preferred the latter although it\\'s slightly more pricey.  Break for lunch at Tahitian, a halal food restaurant No food or drinks are allowed in and bags are checked. We had fantastic food at Tahitian Terrace which serves halal meals for Muslims (us). Its every kids dream to go to Disneyland. There is nothing not to like. Lots of attractions, rides. Most of the rides are child-friendly not like Universal Studios. Alot of cafes & restaurants and theres even a new Halal Restaurant in there. Here in Tahitian restaurant in adventure land you have option of eating Halal food and also option of eating Indian and Thai food as well. Approximately meal cost for a combo is HKD75-80. Drinks (fresh juice/soft drink) HKD25 minimum.<br /><br />Overall its good not bad thou. Have fun! There is a halal food outlet as well which is certified by the  Hk islamic council The good thing about the Park is that staff are very friendly, very neat and clean, and has a \"Halal Food\" restaurant that could be enjoyed by muslim travellers.  I found this Park little cheaper than EuroDisney, especially in the entrance fees and Disney shops Cons: Crowd, queues, limited Halal certified food outlets. Not only were the place super clean (as were all other parts of Hong Kong), they had a section of halal food area specifically for Muslims! I was impressed!  We had our lunch at the Tahitian Terrace in Adventureland, the only Halal certified restaurant in Disney. They served a few choices of rice with fish/ chicken/ vege, singapore laksa (the kids love it), biryani with chicken and they also have vegetarian food as well.  Availability of new halal food outlet really helpful for muslims. A little bit pricey but guess what..it\\'s Disneyland There\\'s one halal certified restaurant located at the Adventureland. We are allowed to bring in our own snacks/sandwiches BUT not cooked food.  For Muslim, there are halal foods available – Singapore food with selection of rice or noodle based dish. Generous portion sufficient for you and your child. However, the price is slightly on the high side. For Malaysian, we paid roughly RM32 (with drinks) on average per person. There is Halal food sold in this park,but is overpriced  and average. They have plenty of cafes & restaurant. And for Muslims, there a Tahitian Restaurant- which is certified halal a lot of restaurants and love it when they also have Halal restaurant in there and make us smiling happily....  As muslims we were very pleased to find delicious halaal food in the Tahitian restaurant, the restaurant also caters for vegetarians. Surely hard to get HALAL food for muslim in here.  There are also halal muslim food at Adventureland which is quite a relieve. But they dont have plenty choices of popcorn bucket as souvenirs, or even slushies cup. Everything seems so expensive here, I wonder why. Halal food in Hong Kong is a bit pricey but taste good. Read in blogs that the French fries and fillet o fish in HK is fried using vegetable oil. Bring instant noodles, bread and brahim\\'s to save some cost. Food was delicious and most importantly certified halal by local Hong Kong Muslim organization.  Halal food was available at the Tahitian Terrace in Adventureland Being a Muslim, there is no halal restaurants (with halal certificate) inside here. But there are vegeterian foods. For Muslims, you can bring along some dry foods/biscuits/chocs or sandwiches. The Disneyland staffs will allow you to bring in those foods as they understand that there\\'s no halal food inside There is no halal food in the park, so we ate the Indian Vegetarian at Adventureland. There is a vegetarian option at most restaurants and cafes. Alternatively, I did read that you could pack your own food and approach the customer service people about your food and they will store it for you. Or you could just load up on the snacks :) The rides is not as challenging as the other disneyland.. the most important thing is just have fun..<br /><br />and for muslim travellers, since there is no halal food here, i personally recommend u bring your own food . To find halal food is no problem at all. They provide amazing vegetarian dishes, and if you go the restaurants, just tell them; no red meat and you’re all set ready to feast! <br /><br />The food court, Riverview Café in Adventure Land. Wide variety of Asian food, Penang laksa, Indian dishes etc.<br /><br />For dinner, head over to the restaurant with tip top service, Plaza Inn. Such beautiful place to dine in. 7 courses dinner! Chinese food all the way baby! Prayer room can be found in the same area as Explorer\\'s Club Restaurant, there are no water bidets in toilets, so tips here, bring a collapsible water bottle & refill it to use as makeshift water bidet. Hongkong Disneyland Park serve Halal Food in Explorer Club and Prayer Room (highly appreciate) Love that the staff had stickers (free! If you asked for them) and the best part was they offered halal certified eateries! ( well done Disney ! ) snacks and even a prayer room ( quiet room) with ablution facilities which was very important as we would want to spend the whole day in Disneyland and won’t want to compromise our prayer times :) they do have halal food and provide prayer room for muslim. for muslims travellers there is a prayers room even with an ablution area! although its not labelled as musolla and it can be use by all religions but i should give credit for  the their thought of having an ablution area. the prayer room is spacious and enclosed so our children could rest for a while while we prayed.  As for us Muslims, we had options of Halal Food at The Explorers’ Cafe and also a little prayer room located next to the cafe If you are Muslim and need a place to prayer, there is an asian restaurant with a cozy Musholla and they will let you pray there even you don\\'t buy food from them Only downside is no muslim prayer room but there is 1 stand near the entrance selling halal food The area completed with a moslem prayer room which very clean but no equipped with the praying clothes, so we have to prepared it by ourselves. The best reason to visit HKDL :  there is halal food and a prayer room available.   As a Muslim, I\\'m very impressed that they also have prayer room complete with the ablutions room. You just need to bring your own praying mat and there you go!  There’s a halal food too here, and also a prayer room (musholla) at Explorer Restaurant (Mystic Zone). Muslim-friendly too - with 1) restaurants serving halal food, 2) large & comfortable prayer hall & ablution rooms. There\\'s also a prayer room for you to perform your solah located at the back of the restaurant-they even has ablution area in the room.  there is also prayer room for moslem It was a nice experience. The thing i love most about this place is they provided a place for us muslims to do prayer. It is situated near a restaurant (im not sure what\\'s the name but the halal one). It is very spacious, and there is a place to take whudu\\' too, so convenient! Thanks u so much Disney HK 😍<br /> They also provide new halal restaurant and a decent prayer room for moslem visitor. Great service overall.  There is also a designated prayer room available. Prayer room can be found beside the toilet at Mystic Point.  One important thing for muslim, they prayer room already move from City Hall to room just next to restroom at The Explorer Club  And if you\\'re a Muslim visitor, they also have a nice and proper prayer room inside. It is located in Mystic Point (if I was not wrong), just right next to the restroom.  Also, if you are a Muslim, know that there is no good dining option and there is no prayer room. It will be difficult to have a place for prayer. I can\\'t find a prayer room, though  Prayer room do have & located at City Hall.  we couldn\\'t find a proper place for our muslim prayers so we just did it on the back lane. for prayer, we went to the City Hall where we were given a nice room to pray there is absence of a prayer room.   There is no masjid (mosque) so little bit difficult for moslem to pray And to be more surprised, the praying room is large enough, clean with a very good ablation room..  the Explore Club restoran have pray room near toilet.   for moslems, you can use VIP room in City Hall near the entrance to pray. just ask the staff there There was a Halal restaurant and a place to pray for muslims which was very good.  For Muslims, they have rooms for you to pray. Just ask any of their staff or get to the City Hall near the entrance. They are very accommodating. Absolutely love it  For muslim, you can ask for a room to pray at the City Hall but you need to perform your abulation at the toilet beside the city hall.'"
